# Cron Scheduler Example

This is a simple Rust Wasm example that demonstrates how to build a cronjob-triggered component in wasmCloud.
When invoked by the `wasmcloud:cron/scheduler` interface, the component receives a JSON payload, logs it, extracts fields (`x1`, `x2`), and makes an outgoing HTTP request with those values as query parameters.

It shows how you can use:

* `wasi:http/outgoing-handler` to send HTTP requests
* `wasmcloud:cron/scheduler` to schedule invocations
* `wasi:logging` to log output

## Prerequisites

* `cargo` 1.75
* [`wash`](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) 0.27.0
* `wasmtime` >=25.0.0 (if running with wasmtime)

## Building

```bash
wash build
```

## Running with wasmtime

You must have wasmtime >=25.0.0 for this to work. Make sure to follow the build step above first.

```bash
wasmtime serve -Scommon ./build/cron_scheduler_s.wasm
```

## Running with wasmCloud

Ensuring you've built your component with `wash build`, you can launch wasmCloud and deploy the full cron scheduling example with the following commands.

```shell
wash up -d
wash app deploy ./wadm.yaml
wash app get
```

Once deployed, the component will be triggered on the cron schedule you configure. Logs will show the JSON payload received and the HTTP request status.

## Example Payload

A sample JSON payload passed by the cron scheduler might look like:

```json
{
  "x1": "foo",
  "x2": "bar"
}
```

This will result in an outgoing request to:

```
http://localhost:3002/payload?foo=bar
```

## Adding Capabilities

To learn how to extend this example with additional capabilities, see the [Adding Capabilities](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/adding-capabilities?lang=rust) section of the wasmCloud documentation.
